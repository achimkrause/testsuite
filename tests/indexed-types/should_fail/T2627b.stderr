    Couldn't match type `t0' with `Dual (Dual t0)'
      `t0' is untouchable
           inside the constraints (b ~ W a2 b2)
           bound at a pattern with constructor
                      Wr :: forall a b. a -> Comm b -> Comm (W a b),
                    in an equation for `conn'
    Expected type: Dual t0
      Actual type: Dual (Dual (Dual t0))
    In the pattern: Wr a r
    In an equation for `conn':
        conn (Rd k) (Wr a r) = conn undefined undefined
