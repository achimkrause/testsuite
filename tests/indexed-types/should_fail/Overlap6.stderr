    Couldn't match type `x' with `And x 'True'
      `x' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for
            g :: Proxy Bool x -> Proxy Bool (And x 'True)
          at Overlap6.hs:15:6
    Expected type: Proxy Bool (And x 'True)
      Actual type: Proxy Bool x
    In the expression: x
    In an equation for `g': g x = x
