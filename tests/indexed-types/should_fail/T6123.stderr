T6123.hs:10:14:
    Couldn't match expected type `a0' with actual type `Id a0'
    The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to:
      `cundefined'
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
                  or use -XNoMonomorphismRestriction
    Relevant bindings include cundefined :: a0 (bound at T6123.hs:10:1)
    In the expression: cid undefined
    In an equation for `cundefined': cundefined = cid undefined
