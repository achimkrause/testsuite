    No instance for (Enum b0)
      arising from the arithmetic sequence `1 .. 10'
    The type variable `b0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    Note: there are several potential instances:

      instance Enum Float -- Defined in `GHC.Float'
      instance Integral a => Enum (GHC.Real.Ratio a)

    Couldn't match type `[a0]' with `a -> b0'
    Expected type: (a -> b0) -> [a] -> t0 a

    Probable cause: `take' is applied to too many arguments
