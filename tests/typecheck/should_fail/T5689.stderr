    Couldn't match expected type `Bool' with actual type `t'
    Relevant bindings include
      r :: IORef (t -> t) (bound at T5689.hs:7:14)
      v :: t (bound at T5689.hs:10:28)
    In the expression: v
    In the expression: if v then False else True
    In the second argument of `writeIORef', namely
      `(\ v -> if v then False else True)'
