    Couldn't match expected type `a'
                with actual type `ListableElem (a, a)'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the instance declaration at <interactive>:6:10
    Relevant bindings include
      asList :: (a, a) -> [ListableElem (a, a)]
        (bound at <interactive>:6:33)
      a :: a (bound at <interactive>:6:41)
      b :: a (bound at <interactive>:6:43)
    In the expression: a
    In the expression: [a, b]
    In an equation for `asList': asList (a, b) = [a, b]
